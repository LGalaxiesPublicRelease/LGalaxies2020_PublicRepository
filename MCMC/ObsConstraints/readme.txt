all files containing observational data sets should be of the following format:
Number_of_Bins
low end of the xbin / high end of the xbin / yvalue / error on y value (for all bins)

The units are the same as in the plots in Henriques et al. 2015:
Number density -> Mpc^-3 h^3
Stellar Masses, Bulge Masses, Gas Masses -> Msun h^-2
BH Masses  -> Msun h^-1
SFR -> yr^-1
SSFR -> Msun h^-2 yr^-1
